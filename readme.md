# Sleep Box #

This is a version of **Sleep Box** as invented and posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook on April 27, 2019. 

## How Does It Work? ##

This sleep box works just like the one Mark created and described (with a couple additional functions I introduced myself). The box emits a faint light at a time that you designate, and keeps emitting it for 60 minutes. For example, if you set it to 6am it will active at that time and will keep emitting a light until 7am.

When it's activated, it starts emitting a light with tiny intensity at first, taking a few minutes to reach a stable intensity. This is to make the activation process smooth, especially if you are sensative to light or sleep in a very dark room. 

There is also a quick demo mode. Once you active the demo mode, the sleep box glows slowly on and off for about a minute. This can be useful if you are testing the box.

## How Do I Use It? ##

There is only 1 button. You can see it when you remove the outer box. 

You press this button as many times as the number of hours from now that you want the sleep box to active. Let's say it is 10pm now and you want the sleep box to go off at 6am, then you press the button 8 times. The box will blink 8 times so you can be sure it was set as you intended. And it will go off at 6am every day (until you reset it or the battery dies).

If you press the button only 1 time, it will go into a demo mode. In a demo mode, the sleep box glows slowly on and off for about a minute. 

Notice, because of the demo mode you can't set the box to active in 1 hour. The soonest you can set it to is 2 hours (2 button presses). Also, the demo mode resets any previous setting so you will need to set the sleep box again.

### Does the Sleep Box Have a Clock? ###

No, this sleep box doesn't have a clock or any display for that matter. I tried to keep the design simple. Also, it kind of defeats its purpose to have a visible clock because it was created to avoid seeing the clock.
