# Sleep Box #

This is a version of **Sleep Box** as invented and posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook on April 27, 2019. 

## How Does It Work? ##

This sleep box works just like the one Mark created and described, with a couple additional functions that I added. The box emits a faint light at a time that you designate, and keeps emitting it for 60 minutes. For example, if you set it to 6am it will active at that time and will keep emitting a light until 7am.

When it's activated, it starts emitting a light with tiny intensity at first, taking a few minutes to reach a stable intensity. This is to make the activation process smooth, especially if you are sensative to light or sleep in a very dark room. 

There is also a quick demo mode. Once you active the demo mode, the box glows slowly on and off for about a minute. This is useful if you are testing it.
