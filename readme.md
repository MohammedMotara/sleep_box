# Sleep Box #

This is a version of **Sleep Box** as invented and posted by [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.facebook.com/zuck) on April 27, 2019. 

## How Does It Work? ##

This sleep box works just like Mark described it in his post (with a couple additional functions I added myself). The box emits a faint light at a time that you designate, and stays lit for 1 hour. For example, if you set it to 6am, it activates at that time and stays lit until 7am.

When it is activated, it starts at a tiny intensity at first and takes a few minutes to reach a stable intensity. If you are sensative to light or sleep in a very dark room, it might be nice that the sleep box lights up smoothly.

There is also a demo mode. Once you activate the demo mode, the sleep box lights up and down for about a minute. This is useful if you want to see what the sleep box looks like when it is lit.

## How Do I Use It? ##

There is only 1 button. You can see it when you remove the outer box. 

You press this button as many times as the number of hours from now that you want the sleep box to activate. For example, if it's 10pm now and you want the sleep box to activate at 6am, then you press the button 8 times. When done pressing, the box will blink as many times as you pressed it so you can be sure it was set as you needed. Once set, the sleep box will activate at the set time every day, until you reset it or until the battery dies.

#### Demo Mode ####

If you press the button only 1 time, it will go into a demo mode. In demo mode, the sleep box lights up and down for about 1 minute. 

Notice, because of the demo mode you can't set the box to active in 1 hour. So the soonest you can set it to is 2 hours from now (2 button presses). Also, the demo mode resets any previous setting so you will need to set the sleep box again.

#### Does the Sleep Box Have a Clock? ####

No, this sleep box doesn't have a clock or any other display. I tried to keep the design simple. Also, it kind of defeats the purpose to have a visible clock because Mark created it to avoid looking at the clock.

## How Can I Make One? ##

Follow these steps if you would like to make this sleep box yourself. 

### 1. Get the Parts ###

1. Arduino Nano microcontroller ($22)
2. Solid oak board 4" x 3' ($10)
3. Four LEDs ($5)
4. Push button ($2)
5. 9V battery ($2)

You will also need some wires, glue, and tools, like a soldering iron and sand paper.

### 2. Make the Outer Structure ###

(coming soon)

### 3. Make the Inner Structure ###

(coming soon)

### 4. Assemble the Electronics ###

(coming soon)

### 5. Upload the Software ###

Upload the code from "sketch_sleepbox.c" into the Arduino unit by connecting the unit to a computer and using the Arduino IDE (the browser version works great) to make the upload.
